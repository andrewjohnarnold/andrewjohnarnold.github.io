Estimating a Dynamic Game of Political Advertising <b style='color:#BD0000;'>(Job Market Paper)</b> [Coming Soon]

        <small> Political candidates in the United States spend billions of dollars airing millions of TV ads each
election cycle. This paper studies the effect of political advertising on the outcomes of competitive elections
to the U.S. Senate between 2000 and 2018. Using time-stamped data on candidates' ad spending and
content, I provide descriptive evidence that candidates' advertising choices are driven by their own
ideologies and political experience, as well as by their opponent's advertising. To gain further insights, I
develop and estimate a dynamic game of political advertising with endogenous ad content, namely whether
an ad is positive or negative. Parameter estimates show that incumbents have a substantial fundraising
advantage over challengers. Positive advertising reinforces this incumbency advantage, while negative
advertising works against it. A counterfactual public campaign financing policy that eliminates the
incumbent's fundraising advantage decreases the incumbent reelection rate by 3.6 percentage points.
Hypothetical temporary bans on negative advertising increase the incumbent reelection rate, but decrease
ideological extremism among the challengers who replace them.</small>

       <small> <em> Abstract </em> &mdash; The objective of this paper is to develop and implement a new
framework for estimating the benefits of policy decentralization. To
accomplish this task, we consider a probabilistic voting model. We show
how to identify and estimate this model using a combination of
roll call data from state legislators and local votes in policy
referenda.  We study the most famous natural experiment ever conducted
with respect to policy decentralization in the U.S., namely the
decentralization of liquor policies at the end of the Prohibition Era.
Compared to the Prohibition Era status quo, we find that aggregate
welfare increases by 1 percent under the optimal uniform centralized
policy. Decentralized policies offer opportunities to account for
heterogeneity in preferences and increase welfare even further.
Compared to the optimal uniform centralized policy, the optimal
decentralized policy increases aggregate welfare by 36 percent. </small>
